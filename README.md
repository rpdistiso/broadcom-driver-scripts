# Broadcom Driver Scripts
This repository will contain WLAN driver installation scripts for those who have Broadcom wireless cards
**Note**: You will have to edit your `/etc/apt/sources.list` to have `contrib` and `non-free` repositories as these are proprietary drivers and aren't FOSS
***Run these scripts using sudo***
